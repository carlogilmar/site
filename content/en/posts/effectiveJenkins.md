Recently, I reviewed a video course from Packt Publishing: **“Effective Jenkins: Improving Quality in the Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins”**

> ##### Thanks to Packt Publishing for this opportunity, and thanks to Dwayne D'Souza for the collaboration!

So, I want to talk about the content of this course.

### Before to Start

This course is for people who know the basics about Jenkins. If you don’t, I would recommend learning about this from their previous courses:

- **Effective Jenkins: Getting Started with Continuous Integration**: https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/effective-jenkins-getting-started-continuous-integration-video

- **Effective Jenkins: Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline**: https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/effective-jenkins-continuous-delivery-jenkins-pipeline-video).

I would also suggest learning **Vagrant** as an added advantage.

Before you start with this course, you will need to know **how to install Jenkins and configure it for the first time**.

> As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.

### The Course

This course, by **Rodrigo Zacheu Russo**, ​has four main topics. In every topic you will learn how to improve a tool as **Jenkins**.

Here is a picture I drew for the main topics:

### Implementing an Acceptance Stage

You will learn about testing! In this section, you are going to run tests!
This chapter teaches you how to improve your quality gate using Jenkins.

### Branching Strategy

Have you ever heard about Feature Branch? No? This chapter talks about it, and how to use Git for implements Git flows for use, in the Jenkins pipeline.

### Automating Database Scripts

As a developer, you have to make Database Migration for version control over the database, you will learn how to make this using Flyway and Jenkins.

### Automating Pull Request

You can automate your pull request by making a connection with GitHub and Jenkins.

### Conclusion

This course goes further than just the use of Jenkins. You will learn four concepts, and you will apply them in an exercise. This course is so great for people who know Jenkins and for novices as well.

### Thanks for reading!
