Follow with learning more about Ember Js as our JS framework, I have to talk about my learning experience.

When I was searching about Ember I found a lot of resources: posts, books, videos, courses and more. Everything looks good, until I had to start my first projects.

### Before to start

> I think that is good to know the context about it. Ember JS was born as a fork from **SproutCore Framework**. Apple was a contributor and develop his web application iWork (iCloud begins) with this framework. Ember Js born from SproutCore 2.0, by **Yehuda Katz**, a member of the jQuery, Ruby on Rails and SproutCore core teams.

> **Apple Music** and **LinkedIn** are two applications developed with Ember JS.

### The Installation and the Development Environment

For install the most recent version, you will need:

- Git
- Node / NPM (most recent LTS)
- Watchman (optional)

If you have this, you could type the following command for install ember:

> npm install -g ember-cli@3.0

Iâ€™m in love with VIM, so I have to install plugins for ES6 and Handlebars.

But if you are using Sublime Text, I recommend install plugins for Handlebars and Ember, and there are other great plugins for other text editor, as VSCode.

I recommend use **Google Chrome** for develop and install the **Ember Inspector Extension.**

### Ember JS Framework

The framework contains the following core libraries

The ember ecosystem contains:

### Hello World!
We are going to use the Ember Cli for create a simple application

> ember new hello-world

And you can see you first application with:

> ember serve

This generate a project with the Ember Structure Folder.

Although Ember has a lot of things created by default, I recommend go step by step.

## Maybe Ember could be hard to learn. But I recommend understand the most important concepts in Ember, and just think how to develop your application in this terms.

For the beginning I recommend understand the most basics things: the routes and the templates. I hope write about this in other post.

## Thanks for read!
